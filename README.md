## Python info

### Instaling Python
  - For Windows and MAC OS use Python official website https://www.python.org/
  - You can also use Virtual Enviroment manager such as Anaconda to download, install and manage Python https://anaconda.org/
  - For Linux systems, most of Linux based OS are already bundled with Python 3.

### Using Python
  - After installing Python on Windows or Mac OS you can use it via the included Python IDE IDLE.
  - Recomended usage of Python is via IDE such as Python specializied Pycharm https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ or via more versitile IDE such as Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - For Linux tryhards, feel free to use VIM and other terminal based editors, the training can be handy for future remote programing via SSH on remote workstations

### Running Python Scripts
  - Most basic way to run simple python script is via the command `python3 YOUR_FILE.py` in terminal or CMD.
  - You can also run Python scripts via your IDE.
  - You can run Python scripts in Python shells, either by running on Windows and MAC OS the Python shell app or on Linux systems running the command `python3` or `python` to run the Pyton shell in your terminal
  - You can also install additional shell based apps such as iPython to access Python shell in terminal or CMD (tested on linux and on Windows with Anaconda enviroment manager)

## Evaluation

### Homeworks
  - A big part of your evaluation will be homeworks
#### Compulsory homeworks
  - Will be automatically evaluated based on the functionality of the code
  - You will be provided unit test script to test your homework by yourself
  - Every homework will have a deadline, missing this deadline will result in points penalty
#### voluntary homeworks
  - Sometimes I will assign additional bonus homework
  - You can achieve only a grade of 100% from such a homework if completed
  - These will be given graded me in the lessons

### Exams
  - There will be at two to three exams through the year

#### Python Exam
  - Will be mainly about basic programing and algorithms
  - An understanding of Python coding style will be required

##### Python Exam topics (this might change through the semester)
  - Written code understanding
  - Code design
  - Sorting algorithms
  - Recursion

#### C Language Exam
  - Will be mainly about basic C and memory managment
  - An understanding of C language coding style will be required

##### C Language Exam topics (this might change through the semester)
  - Written code understanding
  - Memory management
  - Data types

#### Third Possible Exam
  - This exam will look deeper into workings of processors
  - logical circuits
  - basic assembly knowledge
